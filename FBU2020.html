Good Morning/Afternoon ladies and gentlemen. 
</br>
Before we get into it, I would like to thank the college, the FBU team and sponsors for their effort to accommodate this get together. 
</br>
The agricultural industry has been and continues to be extremely competitive.
</br>
Those of you in the audience today have survived and thrived where many others have failed. 
</br>
Knowing your competition is the first step in being competitive and by attending events such as today with your fellow farmers you will have the know how to stay competitive..

Im here today to discuss the opportunities and risks of the next generation of technologies in farming, from a farmers point of view.  
</br>
Technology is often seen as a silver bullet that will make everyone lives better, but this is far from the truth. 
</br>
Automation and technology does not make everyone better off.

We will be discussing the what when and how of technology adoption.

</br>
Not that long ago I did believe that technology was a silver bullet and that aces was the only problem, I worked on many open source technologies that reduce the financial barriers to farming technology. 

Then the Nuffield farming trust sent me around the globe to meet with farmers, governments and everyone in-between. To investigate technology in agriculture who was it benefiting and can the UK learn from other countries practices for technology development and adoption. 
</br>
and the answer is yes on many levels. 
</br>
Reading a lot of books and meeting with a lot of farmers built my understanding on technology development and adoption. 
</br>
Independent of location the farmers benefiting from technology all had similar characteristics.
</br>
-They are all choosing technology that gives them a advantage over their competition. 
</br>
-But more than just choosing they are using technology efficiently.
</br>
-There is no perfect solution when it comes to technology, you choose the best option at the time for your farming operation.

In order to understand who will benefit from technology in farming, we must look at who it has benefited in the past. 

</br>
-The introduction of mechanisation in the form of the tractor and basic agronomy technology, has driven the production capabilities in agriculture up year on year. 

</br>
You the farmer are producing more than ever, but could be seeing little returns for your increased output.

<!----------------------------------- Notes For Slide ------>
<aside class="notes">
	
</br>
In order to benefit from adopting technology it has to be a useful technology that makes you better at something you or your customers care about. 
</br>
You can get a big head start from adopting a technology early on before the majority of your industry follow suit and the price drops to reflect the new production cost. But there are also big advantages to assessing the technology your currently using, is there any low hanging fruit to be had from better utilising the technology you already have. 

So in summary, choose the right technology before your competition and ensure you re you using it better than your competition.

Cool does not mean useful 
</br>

Data does not mean valuable

Technology should be used to make your life easier as a farmer

<!----------------------------------- Notes For Slide ------>
<aside class="notes">
	
Technology should be used to make your life easier as a farmer.
If it isn't increasing the efficiencies of things you care about or saving you time then you need to ask is it beneficial to your business?. 

Not all technology is useful, even the really cool and impressive looking stuff may not be useful to your farm. 

If the word data arises as a benefit of a technology, make sure to ask yourself is the data useful and if so is it in a format that you can easily use without dedicating your life to data analysis. 

Know what you want. Know what's important to you.

<!----------------------------------- Notes For Slide ------>
<aside class="notes">
</br>
A term that I belive will be getting a lot more attention in agriculture is the tripple bottom line, its a formal way of measuring and prioratising the things that are important to you as a farmer. Distributors and buyers are likley to start benchmarking your business as a whole. 
 
</br>
It is useful to asses a technology against the three criiteria, using metrics from each that are important to you or your buyer. A good technology will have a possitive benefit to each catagory. 
Insert technology that decreases production cost while being safer for the staff and reduces the stress ap[lied to the land.

						<h3>When: Adopting before the competition</h3>

<!----------------------------------- Notes For Slide ------>
<aside class="notes">
	
If you want to be competitive you need to know your competition.
</br>
A good technology choice is one that your competition will be using in the future, the best time to adopt is before it becomes industry norm. 
</br>
When technology enters an industry it takes time to work its way to all the businesses, the chart shows a simplified representation of this time delay. 
</br>
The further to the left of the graph that you sit and the bigger return on investment you stand to get from technology, but the risk also increases. there is no shame in being risk averse and not everyone has what it takes to be an innovator or early adopter. 
Go on to discuss the characteristics of the groups and how networking and industry engagement are key to making solid technology choices.
</br>
 By being here at this get together networking with your industry and fellow farmers, its likely that you understand your industry and have a idea of what technology would help your farm before the majority of your competition.

					<h2>How: using it better than your competition </h2>


<p>  
Technology is a tool, it will only be useful if you use it well.
</br>
This includes staff. 
 </p>


<!----------------------------------- Notes For Slide ------>
<aside class="notes">
Technology is only useful if your using it well, technology adoption is more than just buying technology.
</br>
Dont just buy and forget, but embrace and periodicity asses its usefulness.
</br>
We are all guilty to some degree of having technology on the farm that does not get fully utilised, even the innovators and early adopters in the audience will have some examples. 	
</br>
There can be big gains from periodical assessing how you are using a technology and looking for opportunities to use it more efficiently. 
</br>
The ROI of technology is impacted by how well the technology is being put to use.

					<h2>How: Example</h2>

<!----------------------------------- Notes For Slide ------>
<aside class="notes">
The worst technology choices are expensive ones that dont get used.
</br>
Because the how of technology adoption is so often overlooked I would like to drive this point a little further than the rest with an example. Without assessing Kip's and benchmarking it can often be challenging to see areas where technology is not being used correctly, but sometimes its staring you in the face.  
</br>
When visiting Mike a poultry farmer in Delaware USA, he was very worried that Avian influenza would put him and his family out of business, so no expense was spared and they invested in a top of the line disinfectant gate that washes down incoming vehicles to the farm with no user input.
It is a fancy and more effective version of the wheel wash that UK farmers put into place during the outbreak of foot and mouth. 
</br>
But if you looked to the left of the automatic wash station, you could see track marks on the grass where drivers had been skipping the wash down system. And I did not see a single vehicle use the system during that visit.   
</br>
Situations like this often stem from the manager/owners not using the technology and setting presidents for the rest of the staff. Whilst a cheap chain link fence would solve the issue of the gate not being used do not forget the power of leading by example. 


</aside>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Slade Start ----------------------------------->				
<section>
					<h2>How: Advice </h2>
<p>  
-Change is a process, it can be understood and managed.
</br>
-Periodically asses and benchmark technology usage.
 </br>
-Lead by example.  
 </p>


<!----------------------------------- Notes For Slide ------>
<aside class="notes">
In the previous example, Mike the poultry farmer had invested in the best technology but failed to use it. A competitor using a cheaper system well, would easily outperform him. 
</br>
Farming is constantly changing and your ability to effectively use a new technology, is heavily dependant on your organisations ability to accept change. Whilst you should always look for quick solutions to promote change do not overlook the power of leading by example and your capacity to promote a organisation ethos of change brings benefit, from all people at all levels of your organisation.

					<h2>Technology Development</h2>
<h4>Are we getting a good ROI for our money</h4>
<img width="900" height="200"  src="reveal/Images/FBU2020/ROI.jpg" alt="Up arrow" >
<p>  
Lots of funding, not much technology to show for it. 
</br> 
As farmers we should be more involved with the technology development funding, voicing our needs from day 1.  
</p>

<!----------------------------------- Notes For Slide ------>
<aside class="notes">
We have discussed how you can better choose when, how and why to adopt technology so that your one of the farmers that benefits from technology. 
</br>
Now I would like to discuss briefly how the UK can be doing better in the development of technology for farmers. So that we have a better choice of solutions to choose from. 
</br>
Quite a lot of funding is allocated to universities around the UK, pots of money that they use to solve problems in farming. These universities have some excellent brains that develop technology for farming.
</br>
But we are not seeing much ROI from our research money, a lot of it is being used to fix problems that dont exist or to produce technology that whilst useful is not usable. As farmers we should take more interest in this industry related research, we will see big benefits from being more involved, especially when it comes to getting our needs across to academia in a language that they can understand.  
</br>
This is where I am reaching out to those of you in the audience from industry bodies, get involved with research funding institutes. Let them know what is really holding the industry back, what solutions we are using now.

<aside class="notes">

In conclusion technology has and will continue to bring about monumental changes in agriculture. So don’t be the last to find out about a  technology in your sector.

Make sure you get out there and network especially with farmers leading your industry.

Ensure that you know what you want from technology, look for data you can act on not just data for data’s sake.

Dont jusy buy and forget tchnology, embrase it and asses it periodicly, think can I be using this better.  

And most importantly Enjoy what you do.

Thank you all.
